# Jpeg-Reverse-Engineering
A School project which aims to implement a reverse-engineered version of the JPG/JPEG encoder/decoder.

Inspired by Dylan Lucas of TheNullProject and various other educational resources.

James R. Weeks and BioElectroMech proved very helpful in the Encoding portion of this project, as very little resources exist online for encoding in JPEG.
